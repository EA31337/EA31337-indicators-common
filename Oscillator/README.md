# Oscillator indicators

Oscillators are a category of technical indicators used in financial markets
analysis.  They are designed to identify overbought or oversold conditions and
potential trend reversals.  Oscillators typically oscillate within a specific
range or between certain values, indicating the momentum or strength of a price
movement.

Oscillators are considered a subset of indicators since they are technical
tools used to analyze price data and generate signals.  They differ from other
types of indicators like trend-following or volume-based indicators because
oscillators are designed to provide information about the short-term price
behavior rather than long-term trends or volume patterns.

Common examples of oscillators include the Relative Strength Index (RSI),
Stochastic Oscillator, Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), and
the Williams %R.  These indicators generate values that fluctuate within
predefined boundaries, typically between 0 and 100 or -100 and +100,
indicating the relative strength or weakness of price movements.

Traders and analysts use oscillators to identify potential buying or
selling opportunities, divergences, and to gauge market conditions such
as overbought or oversold levels.  They can be helpful in identifying
potential trend reversals or determining the strength of an ongoing
trend.

In summary, oscillators are a type of indicator used in technical
analysis that measure price momentum and provide insights into
overbought or oversold conditions.  They are considered a subset of
indicators due to their specific function and characteristics.

## AO (Awesome Oscillator)

The Awesome Oscillator (AO) is a technical indicator designed to identify the
momentum of a market and potential trend reversals. It displays the difference
between a 34-period and a 5-period simple moving average (SMA) on a histogram.

The calculation of the Awesome Oscillator involves subtracting the 34-period
SMA from the 5-period SMA. The resulting value is then plotted as a histogram,
with positive values indicating bullish momentum and negative values
indicating bearish momentum.

The AO helps traders identify the strength and direction of a trend. When
the histogram bars are above the zero line, it suggests that bullish
momentum is dominant, signaling a potential uptrend. Conversely, when the
bars are below the zero line, it indicates bearish momentum, suggesting a
potential downtrend.

The AO also provides signals for potential trend reversals. A change from
positive bars to negative bars or vice versa is considered a signal for a
potential trend reversal. Traders often look for these transitions to
generate buy or sell signals.

Additionally, the Awesome Oscillator can be used to identify the divergence
between the indicator and price action. Divergence occurs when the
indicator's movement deviates from the price movement. Bullish divergence
occurs when the price forms lower lows while the AO forms higher lows,
suggesting a possible upward reversal. Conversely, bearish divergence
occurs when the price forms higher highs while the AO forms lower highs,
indicating a potential downward reversal.

Traders often combine the Awesome Oscillator with other indicators or
analysis techniques to validate signals and strengthen their trading
strategies. It is a versatile tool that can be applied to various
timeframes and markets.

In summary, the Awesome Oscillator (AO) is a technical indicator that
measures the momentum of a market and identifies potential trend reversals.
It displays the difference between a 34-period and a 5-period simple moving
average on a histogram. Positive histogram bars indicate bullish momentum,
negative bars indicate bearish momentum, and transitions can signal
potential trend reversals. The AO is often used in conjunction with other
indicators and analysis techniques to enhance trading decisions.

## ASI (Accumulation Swing Index)

The Accumulation Swing Index (ASI) is a technical indicator that aims to gauge
the strength and direction of a market's price movement.
It combines price action and volume to provide insights into market trends
and potential reversals. The ASI calculates a running cumulative total,
incorporating the relationship between the current close, previous close,
and recent price ranges.

The ASI starts with an initial value, typically zero, and then factors
in price and volume data. If the current close is higher than the previous close,
the indicator adds a fraction of the current range (high minus low)
to the prior ASI value. Conversely, if the current close is lower,
a fraction of the current range is subtracted.
The fraction is determined based on the volume and price relationship.

The ASI's cumulative total fluctuates, reflecting the strength of price movements.
Rising ASI values indicate buying pressure and potential uptrends,
while falling values suggest selling pressure and potential downtrends.
Traders often analyze the ASI for divergences from price action,
which can signal shifts in market sentiment.

The ASI is typically plotted as a line chart.
Positive values above zero indicate accumulation or buying pressure,
while negative values below zero indicate distribution or selling pressure.
The crossover of the ASI line with zero may be considered a signal
for potential trend reversals.

It's important to note that the ASI does not provide specific
buy or sell signals on its own. Traders commonly use it in conjunction
with other technical analysis tools and indicators
to validate trading decisions and identify potential entry or exit points.

In summary, it is a technical indicator that combines price action
and volume to assess market strength and direction.
It calculates a running cumulative total based on the relationship
between current and previous prices, incorporating price ranges.

## ATR (Average True Range)

The Average True Range (ATR) is a technical indicator used to measure and
quantify market volatility. It provides traders with information about the
average price range or volatility of an asset over a specified period.

The ATR is calculated by taking the average of the true ranges of price
movements. The true range is the greatest of the following three values: the
difference between the current high and the current low, the absolute value of
the difference between the current high and the previous close, and the
absolute value of the difference between the current low and the previous
close.

The ATR is typically displayed as a line chart or a histogram, indicating the
level of volatility in the market. Higher ATR values suggest greater
volatility, while lower values indicate lower volatility.

Traders use the ATR in various ways. It helps determine the appropriate
placement of stop-loss orders by considering the average volatility of the
asset. A wider stop-loss may be used in more volatile markets to account for
larger price fluctuations, while a tighter stop-loss may be suitable for less
volatile markets.

The ATR can also be used to identify potential trend reversals. A sudden
increase in the ATR may indicate a shift in market sentiment or the start of a
new trend. Traders may look for breakouts or changes in price behavior when the
ATR rises significantly.

Additionally, the ATR can be used to compare volatility across different assets
or timeframes. By comparing ATR values, traders can assess which assets or
timeframes are experiencing higher or lower levels of volatility.

In summary, the Average True Range (ATR) is a technical indicator that measures
market volatility by calculating the average price range over a specified
period. It helps traders determine stop-loss levels, identify potential trend
reversals, and compare volatility between assets or timeframes. The ATR
provides valuable insights into market conditions and assists traders in
managing risk and making informed trading decisions.

## Bears Power

The Bears Power indicator is a technical analysis tool that helps traders
assess the strength of the bearish (downward) momentum in the market. It is
designed to identify potential selling opportunities and determine whether the
bears or sellers have control over the market.

The Bears Power indicator is calculated by subtracting the exponential moving
average (EMA) of the closing prices from the highest price of a given period.
The resulting value is plotted as a histogram below the price chart. The
histogram represents the strength of the bearish pressure in the market.

When the Bears Power histogram is above the zero line, it indicates that the
bears are dominating the market, exerting downward pressure. The higher the
histogram bars, the stronger the bearish momentum. Conversely, when the
histogram is below the zero line, it suggests that the bulls (buyers) may have
more control or that the market is experiencing a temporary pause in the
downward movement.

Traders use the Bears Power indicator in several ways. First, they look for
divergences between the price and the indicator. If the price is making lower
lows while the Bears Power histogram is making higher lows, it may indicate a
potential bullish divergence and suggest a weakening of the bearish momentum,
signaling a possible trend reversal or a price bounce.

Second, traders observe the movement of the Bears Power histogram
relative to the zero line. When the histogram crosses below the zero
line from above, it can be seen as a bearish signal, suggesting that
the downward momentum is strengthening. Conversely, when the
histogram crosses above the zero line from below, it can be viewed as
a bullish signal, indicating a potential shift in momentum towards
the upside.

It's important to note that the Bears Power indicator is not a
standalone tool and should be used in conjunction with other
technical indicators or analysis techniques to confirm signals.
Traders often combine it with trend-following indicators,
oscillators, or support and resistance levels to gain a comprehensive
understanding of the market conditions.

In summary, the Bears Power indicator helps traders assess the
strength of bearish momentum in the market. It uses a histogram to
represent the intensity of the downward pressure. Traders can use the
indicator to identify potential trend reversals, divergences, and
selling opportunities. However, it should be used alongside other
tools and analysis techniques for better accuracy and confirmation of
signals.

## Bulls Power

The Bulls Power indicator is a technical analysis tool that assists traders in
evaluating the strength of the bullish (upward) momentum in the market. It aims
to identify potential buying opportunities and determine whether the bulls or
buyers have control over the market.

The Bulls Power indicator is calculated by subtracting the exponential moving
average (EMA) of the closing prices from the lowest price of a given period.
The resulting value is plotted as a histogram above the price chart. The
histogram represents the strength of the bullish pressure in the market.

When the Bulls Power histogram is above the zero line, it suggests that the
bulls are dominating the market, exerting upward pressure. The higher the
histogram bars, the stronger the bullish momentum. Conversely, when the
histogram is below the zero line, it indicates that the bears (sellers) may
have more control or that the market is experiencing a temporary pause in the
upward movement.

Traders utilize the Bulls Power indicator in various ways. Firstly, they look
for divergences between the price and the indicator. If the price is making
higher highs while the Bulls Power histogram is making lower highs, it may
indicate a potential bearish divergence and suggest a weakening of the bullish
momentum, signaling a possible trend reversal or a price correction.

Secondly, traders observe the movement of the Bulls Power histogram relative to
the zero line. When the histogram crosses above the zero line from below, it
can be seen as a bullish signal, suggesting that the upward momentum is
strengthening. On the other hand, when the histogram crosses below the zero
line from above, it can be viewed as a bearish signal, indicating a potential
shift in momentum towards the downside.

It's important to note that the Bulls Power indicator is not used as a
standalone tool and should be combined with other technical indicators or
analysis techniques to confirm signals. Traders often incorporate it with
trend-following indicators, oscillators, or support and resistance levels to
obtain a comprehensive understanding of the market dynamics.

In summary, the Bulls Power indicator helps traders assess the strength of
bullish momentum in the market. It employs a histogram to represent the
intensity of the upward pressure. Traders can utilize the indicator to identify
potential trend reversals, divergences, and buying opportunities. However, it
should be employed alongside other tools and analysis techniques to enhance
accuracy and confirm signals.

## CCI (Commodity Channel Index)

The Commodity Channel Index (CCI) is a versatile technical indicator that
measures the current price level relative to its average over a specified
period of time. It was developed by Donald Lambert in the late 1970s as a tool
for identifying cyclical trends and overbought or oversold conditions in the
market.

The CCI is calculated using the following steps:

1. Calculate the typical price, which is the average of the high, low, and
   closing prices.

2. Calculate the simple moving average (SMA) of the typical price over a
   specified period.

3. Calculate the mean deviation, which measures the average difference
   between each typical price and the SMA.

4. Divide the difference between the typical price and the SMA by a constant
   multiple of the mean deviation to normalize the indicator.

The resulting CCI value fluctuates above and below a zero line. Positive
values indicate that the price is above the average, suggesting bullish
conditions, while negative values indicate that the price is below the
average, suggesting bearish conditions.

Traders primarily use the CCI to identify overbought and oversold conditions
in the market. When the CCI moves above a certain threshold (e.g., +100), it
suggests that the market is overbought and may be due for a reversal or
correction. Conversely, when the CCI drops below a threshold (e.g., -100),
it indicates that the market is oversold and may be ripe for a bounce or
potential upward move.

Additionally, the CCI can help traders spot divergences between the
indicator and price action. Bullish divergences occur when the price makes
lower lows, but the CCI forms higher lows, indicating potential upward
momentum. Bearish divergences occur when the price makes higher highs, but
the CCI forms lower highs, suggesting potential downward pressure.

It's important to note that the CCI is not a standalone indicator and should
be used in conjunction with other technical analysis tools and indicators to
confirm signals. Traders often combine the CCI with trend lines, support and
resistance levels, or other oscillators to enhance its effectiveness.

In summary, this indicator is a technical indicator that measures the current
price level relative to its average over a specified period. It helps identify
overbought and oversold conditions in the market and can indicate potential
reversals or corrections. Traders use the CCI in conjunction with other tools
to make more informed trading decisions.

## CHV (Chaikin Volatility)

The Chaikin Volatility (CHV) indicator is a technical analysis tool that
measures the volatility of a financial instrument based on the difference
between high and low prices over a specific period. It was developed by Marc
Chaikin to help traders assess market volatility and identify potential trading
opportunities.

The resulting value represents the Chaikin Volatility, which is typically
displayed as a line graph. Higher values indicate greater volatility, while
lower values suggest lower volatility.

Traders use the Chaikin Volatility to assess the potential magnitude of price
movements. When volatility is high, it may present opportunities for traders
seeking larger price swings. Conversely, low volatility may indicate a period
of consolidation or indecision in the market.

In addition to identifying volatility levels, the Chaikin Volatility can also
be used to identify potential breakouts. When the indicator shows low
volatility followed by a significant increase, it may indicate an impending
price breakout or trend change.

## DeMarker

The DeMarker indicator, developed by Thomas DeMark, is a technical analysis
tool that helps identify potential overbought and oversold conditions in the
market. It measures the demand for an asset by comparing the current price to
the previous price range.

The DeMarker indicator calculates values ranging from 0 to 1 and is typically
displayed as a line graph. It is based on the concept that price exhaustion
often occurs when the indicator reaches extreme levels.

Interpreting the DeMarker indicator involves identifying overbought and
oversold conditions. Typically, when the indicator reaches values near 1, it
suggests that the market is overbought, indicating a potential reversal or
price correction. Conversely, values near 0 indicate oversold conditions,
suggesting a potential buying opportunity.

## DPO (Detrended Price Oscillator)

The Detrended Price Oscillator (DPO) is a technical analysis indicator that
helps traders identify cycles and overbought/oversold conditions in the market
by removing the underlying trend from the price data. It aims to highlight
short-term price cycles and potential reversal points.

The DPO calculates the difference between a specific price point and a
displaced moving average, typically a simple moving average (SMA) of the price
over a certain period. The displacement is usually set to half of the chosen
period, effectively centering the moving average on the price chart.

The resulting values are plotted on a separate oscillator chart, with zero as
the centerline. Positive values indicate that the current price is above the
displaced moving average, while negative values indicate that the current price
is below the displaced moving average.

Traders analyze the Detrended Price Oscillator to identify short-term cycles
and potential trend reversals. When the DPO crosses above the zero line, it may
suggest a bullish signal, indicating a potential buying opportunity.
Conversely, when the DPO crosses below the zero line, it may suggest a bearish
signal, indicating a potential selling opportunity.

It's important to note that the DPO focuses on eliminating the longer-term
trend component from the price data, allowing traders to analyze shorter-term
price patterns and cycles. It is recommended to use the DPO in conjunction with
other technical indicators, chart patterns, and risk management strategies to
make well-informed trading decisions.

## Gator 1 (based on 3 non-shifted moving averages)

The Gator Oscillator is a technical indicator based on three non-shifted moving
averages. It is designed to help traders identify the presence and strength of
trends in the market. The indicator consists of two histogram bars, each
representing the convergence or divergence of the moving averages.

The Gator Oscillator utilizes three non-shifted moving averages, typically
calculated over different time periods. These moving averages are often
referred to as the Jaw, Teeth, and Lips. The Jaw represents the slowest moving
average, followed by the Teeth and then the Lips.

When the three moving averages are intertwined or in close proximity, it
indicates a dormant or non-trending market. In this phase, the Gator Oscillator
shows a histogram bar that is close to zero, indicating a lack of significant
price movement.

As the market starts to trend, the moving averages diverge from each other, and
the Gator Oscillator histogram bars begin to show divergence as well. The
magnitude and direction of the histogram bars correspond to the strength and
direction of the trend.

When the histogram bars are above zero, it suggests a bullish trend, with the
green bar indicating a stronger bullish momentum. Conversely, when the
histogram bars are below zero, it suggests a bearish trend, with the red bar
indicating a stronger bearish momentum.

Traders often use the Gator Oscillator to confirm trends identified by other
indicators or to anticipate potential trend reversals. It can also help
identify periods of consolidation or range-bound markets.

## Gator 2 (based on shifted Alligator buffers)

The Gator Oscillator is a technical indicator that works in conjunction with
the Alligator indicator, which is also developed by Bill Williams. It helps
traders identify the presence of trends and the degree of their strength in the
market.

The Gator Oscillator consists of two histogram bars, each derived from the
shifted Alligator indicator. The Alligator indicator itself consists of three
lines, known as the Jaw, Teeth, and Lips, which represent different moving
averages applied to different time periods.

The Gator Oscillator uses the shifted Alligator buffers to calculate the
difference between the Jaw and Teeth lines, and the difference between the
Teeth and Lips lines. These differences are then represented as the histogram
bars of the Gator Oscillator.

When the histogram bars are above the zero line, it indicates that the market
is in an active phase, with increasing momentum. The green bar represents the
difference between the Jaw and Teeth lines, while the red bar represents the
difference between the Teeth and Lips lines.

Conversely, when the histogram bars are below the zero line, it suggests that
the market is in a dormant or non-trending phase, with decreasing momentum. The
green bar indicates the difference between the Teeth and Lips lines, while the
red bar represents the difference between the Jaw and Teeth lines.

Traders often use the Gator Oscillator to confirm trends identified by the
Alligator indicator, as well as to spot potential trend reversals. It can also
provide insights into the strength of the prevailing trend.

## MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)

MACD measures the relationship between two moving averages
of an asset's price. It consists of a MACD line and a signal line.
The MACD histogram represents the difference between the MACD line
and the signal line and provides insights into the momentum of the trend.

## RSI (Relative Strength Index)

RSI compares the magnitude of recent price gains to recent price losses
to determine if an asset is overbought or oversold.
It oscillates between 0 and 100,
with values above 70 indicating overbought conditions
and values below 30 indicating oversold conditions.

## Stochastic

The Stochastic Oscillator compares the closing price of an asset
to its price range over a specific period.
It generates values between 0 and 100,
where readings above 80 suggest overbought conditions,
and readings below 20 indicate oversold conditions.

## WPR (Williams Percent Range)

WPR indicator is a momentum oscillator developed by Larry Williams.
It is used to identify overbought and oversold conditions in the market
and potential trend reversals.
The WPR indicator oscillates between -100 and 0,
with readings above -20 considered overbought
and readings below -80 considered oversold.

The WPR indicator calculates the percentage of the difference
between the current closing price and the highest high over a specified period,
relative to the difference between the highest high
and the lowest low over the same period.
The formula is then inverted and multiplied by -100 to obtain the WPR value.

When the WPR indicator reaches or exceeds the -20 level,
it suggests that the market is overbought,
meaning the price may have risen too far too quickly,
and a reversal or correction may occur.
Conversely, when the WPR indicator falls to or below the -80 level,
it indicates oversold conditions, implying that the price may have declined
too rapidly and could potentially reverse to the upside.
